RTCEmergency
============

Our RTCEmergency app from TADHack 2014.

Requirements
------------

* [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/)
* [express.js](http://expressjs.com/) with [serve-static](https://github.com/expressjs/serve-static) and [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser)
* [socket.io](http://socket.io/)
* [simple-nexmo](https://github.com/CalvertYang/simple-nexmo)

You will also need access/credentials to the [Nexmo API](https://www.nexmo.com/).

Installation
------------

It's fairly straight forward from a working Node.JS/NPM environment:

	npm install

This will grab all of the dependencies you need. Then edit config/server.json with your Nexmo API credentials.
